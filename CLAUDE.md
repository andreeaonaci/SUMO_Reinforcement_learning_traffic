# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A research pipeline for **federated reinforcement learning of a single shared traffic-signal
policy** across multiple SUMO-simulated cities (intersections of different topologies: single
intersection, 3x3/4x4 grids, RESCO cologne3/ingolstadt7/grid4x4). One DQN architecture — a
foundation model — controls every intersection in every city; topology differences (3-way vs
5-way, missing neighbors, etc.) are expressed entirely through `action_mask` / `neighbor_mask`,
never through per-topology code paths. `PROJECT_FLOW.md` has a detailed module-by-module trace
of the `--parallel` execution path (call hierarchy, class responsibilities, data flow) — read it
before making non-trivial changes to the federated training path.

## Setup

Requires SUMO installed with `SUMO_HOME` set:

```bash
export SUMO_HOME=/usr/share/sumo
export PYTHONPATH="$SUMO_HOME/tools:$PYTHONPATH"
pip install .            # or: pip install .[rendering] for pyvirtualdisplay support
```

`bash setup_wsl.sh` does a one-time WSL/Ubuntu setup (apt SUMO packages + pip deps).

## Common commands

Federated training (parallel = one worker process per city, recommended):
```bash
python -m experiments.federated_training --parallel --rounds 10 --local_episodes 2 \
    --aggregation_strategy fedavg --lr 3e-4 --lr_decay 0.97 --min_lr 1e-5
```
Key flags: `--seed`, `--eval_every`, `--eval_episodes`, `--aggregation_strategy`
{fedavg, ema_alignment, clustered_fedavg, ...}, `--n_clusters` (for clustered_fedavg),
`--no_federation` (train each city independently, no aggregation), `--baseline_controller`
{fixed_time, max_pressure} (skip training, evaluate a rule-based controller instead),
`--tau`/`--target_update` (DQN target network), `--base_dir` (which `environments*/` roster to
use — see "City configs" below), `--disable_head_fix` (ablation: turn off masked-head
aggregation).

Each run creates a timestamped directory under `results/run_<timestamp>/` with the global model
checkpoint and `federated_history.json`.

Evaluate a trained model:
```bash
python experiments/evaluate.py --model results/global_fed.pth --episodes 5
```

Other experiment entry points in `experiments/`: `local_training.py` (single-city, no
federation), `centralized.py` (centralized baseline), `run_nacrl.py`, `sarsa_double.py`,
`sarsa_resco.py`, `sanity_check.py`, `validate_sumo_cities.py` (checks every city config loads),
`plot_convergence.py`, `analyze_phase0.py`, `analyze_phase1.py`.

Phase 1 ablation sweep (7-city roster x 5 seeds x multiple aggregation strategies + rule-based
baselines; skips runs already completed): `bash analyse/run_phase1_ablation.sh`. Output lands in
`results/phase1/<run_name>/`; summarize with
`python experiments/analyze_phase1.py --results_root results/phase1`.

Tests:
```bash
pytest tests/                      # gym_test.py (Gymnasium API), pz_test.py (PettingZoo API)
```

Lint/format (pre-commit hooks: flake8, black, isort, pyupgrade, pydocstyle, pyright, codespell):
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
`experiments/`, `nets/`, and `tests/` are excluded from flake8/pydocstyle. black line-length is
127.

## Architecture

### Two execution paths
- **Parallel** (`--parallel`, `federated/parallel_server.py::ParallelFederatedServer`): spawns
  one persistent worker process per city (multiprocessing, spawn context). Each worker keeps a
  warm SUMO environment + replay buffer alive across rounds; the main process only ships model
  state dicts back and forth each round. This is the path used for real training runs.
- **Sequential** (`federated/server.py::FederatedServer`, via `federated/client.py`): builds and
  tears down each city's environment every round in a single process. Simpler, used for
  quick/mock runs and debugging.

Both converge on the same round loop: broadcast global weights → each city trains locally for
`--local_episodes` episodes → collect updated state dicts + sample counts → aggregate → evaluate
on the holdout city → checkpoint.

### Observation/action contract (the thing that makes topology-agnostic RL work)
Defined and documented in `agents/networks.py` and built by
`environments/federated_env.py::MultiAgentFederatedWrapper`. Every intersection, in every city,
produces the same shape regardless of topology:
- `own_obs (D_own,)` — fixed-size own-intersection features (built by `LaneExtractor` →
  `LaneNormalizer`/`LaneSorter` → `TopKEncoder`)
- `neighbor_obs (K_MAX, D_nbr)` — zero-padded per-neighbor features (`NeighborGraphBuilder` finds
  K-hop neighbors from the SUMO net topology; `NeighborSummaryExtractor` summarizes each one)
- `neighbor_mask (K_MAX,)` — 1.0 valid neighbor this tick, 0.0 padded or comm-dropped
- `hop_dist (K_MAX,)` — hop distance per neighbor slot
- `action_mask (A_MAX,)` — 1.0 = real action for this intersection's actual phase count, 0.0 =
  padding. This replaces any hand-written per-topology phase mapping; `ActionSpaceInspector`
  discovers valid action counts by probing SUMO directly. `ActionMaskPadder` pads every city's
  action space up to the shared global width (`max_action_dim`) so one Q-head serves all cities.

The network (`agents/networks.py::NeighborAttentionQNetwork`) never sees which city/topology an
observation came from — everything topology-specific is expressed purely through the masks.

`CommDropoutWrapper` (`federated/comm_dropout.py`) sits around the environment during both
training and eval and corrupts `neighbor_mask`/`neighbor_obs` per `p_link`/`p_isolate`/
`p_hop_cutoff`, simulating unreliable inter-intersection communication.

### Aggregation strategies
`federated/aggregation_strategies.py` implements multiple pluggable strategies behind
`build_aggregation_strategy()`: `FedAvgStrategy` (sample-count-weighted average, not equal
weighting), `EMALossImprovementStrategy`, `EMAGradientAlignmentStrategy`,
`LearningVelocityNoveltyStrategy`, `GradientSurvivalStrategy`, `ClusteredFedAvgStrategy`
(clusters cities by `action_dim` and aggregates within-cluster). `federated/aggregation.py`
has the underlying `fed_avg`/`weighted_average`/`masked_head_weighted_average` primitives — the
masked-head variant only averages the Q-head slots that were actually active for each
contributing city, since action spaces differ in width.

### Agent
`agents/dqn.py::DQNAgent` is the single shared Q-learning agent class used both as the global
model and as each worker's local model — same class, same architecture, just different weights
in flight. Holds the online/target networks, `ReplayBuffer`, optimizer, and epsilon schedule.

### Evaluation
`federated/evaluator.py::HoldoutEvaluator` evaluates the aggregated global model (or a rule-based
baseline controller) on a held-out city not used in training (`city_5_holdout` in the default
7-city roster) — reward, waiting time, action distribution, and Q-gap diagnostics.

### City configs
Each city is a directory under `environments/` (`city_1` … `city_7`, `city_5_holdout`) holding a
`config.yaml` that points at a SUMO `.net.xml`/`.rou.xml` pair under `sumo_rl/nets/` plus
sim params (`delta_time`, `num_seconds`, `k_max`, `max_hops`, `use_libsumo`, ...).
`city_5_holdout` is auto-excluded from training and reserved for `HoldoutEvaluator`.
`environments_phase0/` and `environments_city1/` are alternate rosters made of symlinks back into
`environments/*` (selected via `--base_dir`) — used to scope which cities a given experiment run
sees, not separate environment implementations. `configs/default.yaml` holds the historical
default hyperparameters (rounds/lr/batch_size); most of these are now overridden via CLI flags in
`experiments/federated_training.py`.

### Diagnostics
`diagnostics/` has standalone one-off scripts for inspecting SUMO route/action-space data
(`inspect_action_spaces.py`, `route_traffic_balance.py`, `measure_approach_volume.py`,
`q_gap_trend.py`, `dump_route_schema.py`, `fix_route_windows.py`) — not part of the training
pipeline, run manually when debugging a specific city's data.

### `sumo_rl/` package
This is the underlying installable Gymnasium/PettingZoo package (`sumo_rl/environment/env.py` is
the single-agent/multi-agent SUMO wrapper it's built on). It's a dependency of the federated
pipeline above, not the pipeline itself — treat `environments/federated_env.py` as the layer that
adapts `sumo_rl` environments into the federated multi-city contract.
